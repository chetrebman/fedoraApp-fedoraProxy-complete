This is a complete working example of the fedoraApp and fedoraProxy web applications.

FedoraApp and fedoraProxy has been used extensively by The Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries and is reliable. However being a single person rather then a software department, I haven't had
the to time to extensively document the big picture, so I choose to create a working example instead.
