  	Classes that access the data for a Fedora Batch Ingest. 
	This data consists of the original metadata in METS XML files and the
	PCOs (primary content objects) that the METS refers to. These METS and
	PCO files will be ingested into Fedora to become a Digital Object (DO). 
	After ingest this package can generates log(report) files and move ingested 
	files into completion and failed folders. There is also a utilitie for spliting
	a file containing multiple METS sections.
