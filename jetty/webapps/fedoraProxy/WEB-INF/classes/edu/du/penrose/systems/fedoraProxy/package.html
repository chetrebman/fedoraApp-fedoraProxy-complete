  The top package for the Penrose Systems FedoraProxy. In addition to providing proxy for accessing Fedora Datasstreams,
  FedoraProxy also provides a frontend for the fedoraApp batch ingest application. The action when a standard batch ingest
  file is posted to http://lib-ram.cair.du.edu/fedoraProxy/ingest.ectd depends on the value of batchCmd element.
  <br></br> <br></br>
  For an add of type normal, the pco's are put into the files directory and the batch file into the work directory. FedoraApp
  then uses a background process to start a ingest process, which processes the batch file in the work directory normally.
  <br></br> <br></br>
  For an add of type replyWithPid, the batch file is split into the mets/new directory with the reserved pid at the top, embeded in
  a comment. FedoraApp then uses a background process to perform the ingest, but skips the normal splitting of the the batch ingest file.
  Once FedoraApp starts the ingest the only difference in processing the met/new directory is that instead of getting the pid from
  Fedora to embed in the FOXML, the pis is taken from the comment that proceeds the mets element in each file to be ingested.
